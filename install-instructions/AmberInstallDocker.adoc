= Containers: Accessing Molecular Dynamics Software on Your Mac
:toc:
Dylan Torres <dylan.l.torres@ucdenver.edu>

== Research and Command-Line-Coding

Conducting applied research in any of the physical sciences is an awesome opportunity - you get to be on the cutting edge of your field! 

But before you can perform any insightful or meaningful work, you'll have to overcome the challenges of working with command-line interfaces. 

Much of the software required to perform computational analysis requires an insane amount of work just to install and run the program - especially if the software was written for a different operating sytem. 

Fortuantely, developments such as Docker made such applications and software more accessible. By the end of this, you will learn how to install a molecular dynamics package called *Amber* on your *Mac* with the use of the *Docker infrastructure*. 

TIP: If you have little to no experience using the Unix Shell, check out this http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/[tutorial].   

== Molecular Dynamics: Amber

http://ambermd.org[Amber Moleclar Dynamics] package can perform 
simulations at the http://ambermd.org/2012_wires.pdf[atomic level], on timescales from femtoseconds to milliseconds! Since its creation in the late 1970s, Amber has gone from using just two languages (Fortran and C) to using Python, Cuda and Pearl with over 850,000 lines of code.This growth forced developers to divide the package into two platforms with the current versions being: *AmberTools18* and *Amber18*.

=== Download the Amber Package
If you already have Amber downloaded, skip to 
Download the following to an easily accesible location,we'll need them later!

==== AmberTools18 (Open Source)
Download http://ambermd.org/GetAmber.php#ambertools[AmberTools18]. The recommended download method is *Option 1: Getting the Source Code*. 
Fill out the required fields to get the `AmberTools18.tar.bz2`. 
// image

==== Amber18 Source Code (License Required)
After purchasing a license (or obtaining one from school/work) for http://ambermd.org/GetAmber.php#ambertools[Amber18], follow the `Amber18.tar.bz2` download instructions sent to you. 

****
[NOTE]
.File Extensions
====
*Tape ARchive (TAR)* files store multiple files in one and are primarily used to archive in Linux/Unix systems. 

*bzip2 (BZ2)* are used to compress TAR files (and others) for quick and easy software distribution.

Docker uses a client-server architecture to ship, build and run appplications in _containers_. 

=== Docker Desktop for Mac

Before you can run Amber in a Docker container, you have to install the Docker software. It is recommended that you install *Docker Desktop*, the newest version of Docker. 

****
*Docker Desktop System Requirements for Mac*
====
. Mac hardware must be a 2010 or new model. You can check to see if your machine is supported by entering the following input and receving the following output in the Terminal:
+
```sh
$ sysctl kern.hv_support
kern.hv_support: 1
```
 . macOS Sierra 10.12 and new releases are supported (new versions recommended).
 . Must have at least 4 GB of RAM
 . VirtualBox software is *NOT* required to run Docker Desktop. However, if it is installed on your computer, the version must be LATER than version 4.3.30.
====
====
NOTE: If your system does not satisfy these requirements, you can download https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/[Docker Toolbox]. *Docker Toolbox* is an installer for older Mac and Windows systems that lacks the full capability of *Docker Desktop*. Successful installation of Amber  with Docker Toolbox cannot be guaranteed.
====
****

=== Install and Run Docker Desktop for Mac
Follow these instrunctions to install and run Docker Desktop. 

. Download the https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg[Docker dmg file].
. Double-click `Docker.dmg` to open the installer, then drag the whale to the Applications folder.
// insert image
+
****
[NOTE]
.File Extensions
====
*DMG* files or, Apple Disk Image Files, are typically used to compress software installers. DMGs are "mounted" as drives and treated by the OS as if they are physical hard drives, making it easy to view their content and install. 
====
****

. Double-click Docker.app in the Applications folder to start Docker. (In the example below, the Applications folder is in ‚Äúgrid‚Äù view mode.)
// insert image
. Authorize `Docker.app` with your system password after Docker is launched.


=== Getting Familiar with Docker

====
NOTE: You can always compare your version of Docker to the latest version by looking at https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/release-notes/[Docker release notes]. 
====
Now that Docker is up  and running, verify that your version of Docker is up to date. Enter the following command in the Terminal:
```sh
  $ docker --version
```
You should receive an output similar to this: 

```sh
  Client: Docker Engine - Community
   Version:           18.09.2
   API version:       1.39
   Go version:        go1.10.8
   Git commit:        6247962
   Built:             Sun Feb 10 04:12:39 2019
   OS/Arch:           darwin/amd64
   Experimental:      false

 Server: Docker Engine - Community
  Engine:
  Version:          18.09.2
  API version:      1.39 (minimum version 1.12)
  Go version:       go1.10.6
  Git commit:       6247962
  Built:            Sun Feb 10 04:13:06 2019
  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64
  Experimental:     false
```

As mentioned, Docker uses *client-server* infrstructure.

The command `docker` allows you to call on the *docker client*. The Docker client docker client communicates with the *engine* of the Docker platform - also known as the *Docker damien*.   

In multitasking computer operating systems a daemon runs as a background process rather than under direct control of an interactive user. 

Fun Fact: the word daemon comes from ancient Greek belief of a supernatural being that lives in the background with with no particular bias toward good or evil. 

=== The Docker Command Line

====
NOTE: The required syntax for executing any Docker command is `docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARG...]`.
====

Everytime you use Docker, you have to call on the Docker client. You can't run Docker without it! 

****
You'll mostly use the Docker client to:
====
. Build Images: `docker build`
. Run Containers: `docker run`
. Setup networking for containers
. Manage disk volumes for the container   
====
****

In the Terminal, run `docker` and you'll get a list 
of available *commands*, *options* and descriptions on how to use them.  

```sh 
$ docker
Usage: docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARG...]
       docker [ --help | -v | --version ]

A self-sufficient runtime for containers.

Options:
      --config string      Location of client config files (default "/root/.docker")
  -D, --debug              Enable debug mode
      --help               Print usage
  -H, --host value         Daemon socket(s) to connect to (default [])
  -l, --log-level string   Set the logging level ("debug"|"info"|"warn"|"error"|"fatal") (default "info")
      --tls                Use TLS; implied by --tlsverify
      --tlscacert string   Trust certs signed only by this CA (default "/root/.docker/ca.pem")
      --tlscert string     Path to TLS certificate file (default "/root/.docker/cert.pem")
      --tlskey string      Path to TLS key file (default "/root/.docker/key.pem")
      --tlsverify          Use TLS and verify the remote
  -v, --version            Print version information and quit

Commands:
    attach    Attach to a running container
    # [‚Ä¶]
```

== Building Your Docker Image 

A Docker *container image* (simply referred to as an _image_) is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of sotware that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. 

First, we need to download the necessary files to build the  image:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/yylonly/AmberDocker.git
```

Now, use `ls` to list the files in your current directory. You should find a new directory named `AmberDocker`. Change to that directory with `cd`.

```sh 
$ ls
AmberDocker
$ cd AmberDocker
AmberDocker $
```

Another `ls` will reveal several files:
```sh
$ ls
README.md	 Dockerfile		src     	
```

****
[NOTE]
.File Extensions
====
The file `README.md` contains instructions for you, the user on how to ensure the image is properly built. `.md` indicates it was written using a text editor called MarkDown. 


The `Dockerfile` contains the instructions for the Docker daemon to build the image. 

`src` is a type of directory used in Unix OS that contain source code. 
====
****

Now, let's open up that `README.md` file:

```sh
$ open README.md
```

****
NOTE: You'll need a text editor to view a `.md` file. You can also view it https://github.com/yylonly/AmberDocker/blob/master/README.md[here]. However, as you become more experienced, you'll benefit from having a text editor like https://code.visualstudio.comhttps://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code].
****

After opening `README.md`, you can see that we already have most of what we need to build our image. All that's left is to download https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/vmd-1.9.3/[VMD-1.9.3(linux-OpenGL Version)].

After downloading, rename the file to `vmd-1.9.3.tar.gz`.

Okay, now move the following files to the AmberDocker directory:

* `AmberTools18.tar.bz2`
* `Amber18.tar.bz2` 
* `vmd-1.9.3.tar.gz`

into the  `/AmberDocker` directory and rename it `vmd-1.9.3-tar.gz`.

FINALLY, it's time to *build the image*! In the AmberDocker directory:

```sh
$ docker build . -t amber18:cpu
```

****
[NOTE]
.Docker Build Command: Build an Image
====
```sh
docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -
```
we used `.`  as the `[PATH]` to build the image in the current `/AmberDocker` directory

`-t` or `--tag list` is an `[OPTION]` that we used to name the container `amber18:cpu`
====
****

Once the image is built, we can search for it by the tag name. 

This process takes about an hour while the Docker client connects to the Docker Daemon to build our image. 



== Running Your Docker Container

A Docker *container* runs an application by packaging all the code and dependencies packaged up neatly so the application runs quickly and reliably. 

It doesn't matter that Amber wasn't written specifically for macOS because the way we have things set up, Amber will run using an operating system within the container! This works by tapping into the network hosted by the Docker daemon.



==== Docker Images Become Containers
To run our image in a countainer, we need to use the `docker run` command. But first, let's check out that `README.md` document again.

According to the instructions, we need to download and install an application called https://www.realvnc.com/download/file/viewer.files/VNC-Viewer-6.19.325-MacOSX-x86_64.dmg[VNC Viewer]. This will provide us with an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu[Ubuntu] graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the container. 

The time has finally come.... let's run our container! In the `/AmberDocker` directory:
```sh
$ docker run --rm -p 5901:5901 -p 6901:6901 -v $(pwd):/data --user 0 amber18:cpu
```


****
[NOTE]
.Docker Run Command: Run an Image in a Container
====
```sh
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

`-rm` Automatically removes the container after it is exited. 

`-p` Pubishes all ports to random ports

`-v` Mounts volumes from the specified container

`--user` User namespace to use
====
****


Open a new terminal window and enter the `ps` (process status) command. This shows containers that are currently running:
```sh
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
c2598f1332ab        amber18:cpu         "/dockerstartup/vnc_‚Ä¶"   10 seconds ago      Up 8 seconds        5901/tcp, 6901/tcp   eloquent_nobel
```

notice the output:

`CONTAINER ID`: an alphanumeric sequence assigned to the container

`IMAGE`: the tag we assigned to the image

This is great, to run the container from now on, all we have to type is:

```sh
$ docker run amber18:cpu
```

To stop the container:
```sh
$ docker stop [CONTAINER ID]
```

==== Connect to the Container

. Open the VNC viewer.
+ 
+
. Access the container (password: `vncpassword`).
+
* Via the VNC application: 127.0.0.1:5901

* Via the web: http://127.0.0.1:6901/vnc.html


== Resources and Troubleshooting
=== Docker

For help with any Docker command, execute the command in question followed by the `--help` option. For example:
```s
$ docker run --help

Usage: docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

Run a command in a new container

Options:
      --add-host value             Add a custom host-to-IP mapping (host:ip) (default [])
  -a, --attach value               Attach to STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR (default [])
...
```
